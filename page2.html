          <p>
            Ben Lomond is one of the most popular Munros, rewarding the 30,000
            people who make it to the top with fantastic views of the length of
            Loch Lomond and far into the hills to the north and the Trossachs to
            the east. The route has been well made, however the optional return
            down the Ptarmigan ridge can be muddy and is rocky in places making
            the going more difficult in poor visibility.
          </p>
          <h3>Terraine</h3>
          <p>
            Clear path with some rocky sections on the alternative rougher
            return route. As with all mountain walks, full hillwalking clothing
            and equipment must be carried. If there is snow on the route this
            includes an ice-axe and crampons.
          </p>
          <h3>Public transport</h3>
          <p>
            None to start. Ssummer ferry from Tarbet Pier to Rowardennan, buses
            to Tarbet from Glasgow and Balloch.
          </p>
          <h3>Hillwalking in Winter</h3>
          <p>
            Please note that hillwalking when there is snow lying requires an
            ice-axe, crampons and the knowledge, experience and skill to use
            them correctly. All route descriptions and difficulties given here
            are for summer conditions. See our Winter Essentials page for basic
            information on the skills, techniques and knowledge needed for
            winter hillwalking.

      <h3 class="description">Walk Description</h3>
      <div class="container">
        <div>
          <h4>Stage 1</h4>
          <p>
            Start from the car park (charge) at Rowardennan where there is an
            information centre and toilets. The mountain is not in view from the
            car park but can be seen from the metal jetty on the loch shore. The
            ascent starts from a clearly marked path at the back of the
            information building. Climb steadily, through oak woods to start
            with and then through an area of cleared forestry where only the few
            silver birch trees remain at present. There are plans to regenerate
            the natural woodland along this stretch of the lochside and the
            felling seen here is part of that plan. After a short while cross a
            track and continue on the uphill path.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Stage 2</h4>
          <p>
            Cross a small bridge and soon there are the first views of part of
            Loch Lomond. Pass through a gate onto the open hill where cattle and
            sheep graze. The path continues to climb at a steady gradient, the
            views of the Loch becoming more impressive with each step. Pass
            through another gate. By the 1990s this section of the path had been
            eroded until it formed a scar up to 25 metres wide, visible from
            Glasgow. The National Trust then began a program of repairs and the
            current, excellent path is only a couple of metres wide. The ground
            becomes less steep and the final peak comes into view with the
            prominent zig-zag of the path visible on the right hand side.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Stage 3</h4>
          <p>
            Keep following the path as it sticks to the broad ridge of the
            mountain. There are good views of the islands in Loch Lomond behind.
            The path climbs steeply on the final ascent to the summit ridge
            before levelling off to curve to the left around the rim of the very
            impressive eastern corrie which has been hidden until this point.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Stage 4</h4>
          <p>
            From the summit trig point there are stunning views in all
            directions, particularly of the southern end of Loch Lomond and its
            islands. It is rare to be alone at the top, as this is one of
            Scotland's favourite mountains, popular with visitors and locals
            including fell runners who make numerous ascents in a year. The
            easiest and most usual route back is to retrace your outward route,
            but there is a rougher alternative.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Stage 5</h4>
          <p>
            For the alternative, harder descent, take the rocky path north-west
            from the summit to descend very steeply to a col before climbing
            south-west to Ptarmigan at 731 metres. From here the route follows
            the nobbly ridge for much of the descent with excellent views down
            Loch Lomond. Approximately half way down the ridge, the distinctive
            shape of the Cobbler comes into view alongside the other peaks of
            the Arrochar Alps on the far side of the Loch to the west. There is
            a clear path although it is narrow and rocky in places. The wettest
            areas have been improved with large stepping stones. About
            two-thirds of the way down the path leaves the true ridge to descend
            below crags and continue on a direct route towards Rowardennan.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Stage 6</h4>
          <p>
            The path passes through a gate and descends more steeply. Before
            reaching some trees at the top of the woodland bear left to go
            through another gate and descend alongside the burn. After an open
            gateway there is a good view of a waterfall. Continue down through
            the woods until the road is reached. Turn left here and walk along
            the road passing behind the Youth Hostel. For the last section it is
            possible to take the path to the right along the shore. This passes
            a modern war memorial sculpture by Doug Cocker of Dundee. Ben Lomond
            and its slopes going down to the loch have been dedicated as a
            Memorial Park to commemorate those who have lost their lives for
            their country. From the memorial continue round the shore a short
            distance to return to the car park.

        One of my favourite things about Glasgow is that it is so close to the
        southern Highlands, that I can see the hills north of the city from my
        living room window. On a sunny day that is… Last weekend was yet another
        glorious sunshine-filled one, so we decided it was time to leave Glasgow
        behind. A rental car was quickly booked for the day and I already knew
        where I wanted to go for this perfect day hike: Ben A’an.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ben A’an is an incredibly popular hill in the southern Highlands – it is
        only 1h20m drive from Glasgow, the trail is signposted and well-kept
        (neither of these are to be taken for granted in Scotland) and it’s
        fairly easy and quick to ascend to the top. On this sunny day we were by
        far not the only ones trying to score a spot in the busy Ben Venue car
        park. There are several trails starting here, but signposts lead the
        way. Finding the right trail and setting off to the top was no problem
        at all!
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail starts from the back of the car park close by the shore of
        Loch Achray. You first hike through a lush forest with tall larch and
        pine trees. The path is quite muddy down here, so watch your step. After
        half an hour or so the landscape changes drastically – the pine trees
        turn into light birch forest and the muddy trail is replaced by rocky
        steps. Soon you meet the old trail and keep ascending. The last bit in
        the woods is pretty steep and steps all the way – prepare your thighs
        and knees for a workout!After an hour or so you reach the treeline. The
        path flattens out and you circle around the northern side of Ben A’an.
        On a sunny day like we had it this means finally some shade!

        There is a lay-by about 100 yards north of the Glengoyne distillery by
        the side of the A81 where you can park. Cross the road, taking extra
        care as the traffic can travel fast, and follow a track going up past
        some white cottages. When the track forks turn right and follow it up
        past a large metal gate and up through trees.After crossing a small burn
        go through a gate on the right and into a field. Bear left to pass in
        front of two large arrays of solar panels and walk diagonally across the
        field, straight towards Dumgoyne hill.
      </p>
      At the far side of the field cross two stiles and then begin the extremely
      steep walk up the obvious path ahead – take your time. As you get further
      up the hill you can look back for views opening up over Loch Lomond – to
      the right of the loch is Conic Hill with Ben Lomond behind it.
      <p>
        Head straight up the steep slope and after ascending over a false
        summit, you reach an upright stone on the top and even more extensive
        views which are simply breathtaking.Descending from the hill is best
        done by retracing your steps back to the start. Make sure to bring
        plenty of water and wear appropriate footwear (walking boots or
        similar).
