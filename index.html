        <h3>One benefit of hiking is more for the core</h3>
        <p>
          Like brisk walking, hiking is a good way to improve your
          cardiovascular fitness, particularly if your route includes some
          hills, which will force your heart to work harder. Taking a hike on
          the slightly uneven surface of a trail also provides a natural way to
          engage the core muscles in your torso and to hone your balance skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you have problems with stability or vision, using walking
          or trekking poles can give you an added level of security on uneven
          terrain. Use poles with a spiked metal tip when walking on dirt or
          grass. Plant the pole out in front of you as you walk to take a little
          pressure off your knee joints.
        </p>

        <h3>Going for a hike can offer natural stress relief?</h3>
        <p>
          Yet another benefit of hiking may be the restorative and
          stress-relieving powers of being outside in nature. A number of small
          studies hint that spending time in green space — nature preserves,
          woodlands, and even urban parks — may ease people’s stress levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving the growing consensus that stress contributes to high blood
          pressure and heart disease risk, anything you can do to mitigate
          stress is likely helpful. In that realm, the benefits of hiking remain
          anecdotal, but outdoor enthusiasts tend to agree. There’s a real sense
          of peace and composure you get from being outside and away from
          everything.

          Ben Lomond is one of the most popular Munros, rewarding the 30,000
          people who make it to the top with fantastic views of the length of
          Loch Lomond and far into the hills to the north and the Trossachs to
          the east. The route has been well made, however the optional return
          down the Ptarmigan ridge can be muddy and is rocky in places making
          the going more difficult in poor visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clear path with some rocky sections on the alternative rougher return
          route. As with all mountain walks, full hillwalking clothing and
          equipment must be carried. If there is snow on the route this includes
          an ice-axe and crampons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that hillwalking when there is snow lying requires an
          ice-axe, crampons and the knowledge, experience and skill to use them
          correctly. All route descriptions and difficulties given here are for
          summer conditions. See our Winter Essentials page for basic
          information on the skills, techniques and knowledge needed for winter
          hillwalking.

        One of my favorite things about Glasgow is that it is so close to the
        southern Highlands, that I can see the hills north of the city from my
        living room window. On a sunny day that is… Last weekend was yet another
        glorious sunshine-filled one, so we decided it was time to leave Glasgow
        behind. A rental car was quickly booked for the day and I already knew
        where I wanted to go for this perfect day hike: Ben A’an.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ben A’an is an incredibly popular hill in the southern Highlands – it is
        only 1h20m drive from Glasgow, the trail is signposted and well-kept
        (neither of these are to be taken for granted in Scotland) and it’s
        fairly easy and quick to ascend to the top. On this sunny day we were by
        far not the only ones trying to score a spot in the busy Ben Venue car
        park. There are several trails starting here, but signposts lead the
        way. Finding the right trail and setting off to the top was no problem
        at all!
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail starts from the back of the car park close by the shore of
        Loch Achray. You first hike through a lush forest with tall larch and
        pine trees. The path is quite muddy down here, so watch your step. After
        half an hour or so the landscape changes drastically – the pine trees
        turn into light birch forest and the muddy trail is replaced by rocky
        steps. Soon you meet the old trail and keep ascending. The last bit in
        the woods is pretty steep and steps all the way – prepare your thighs
        and knees for a workout!After an hour or so you reach the treeline. The
        path flattens out and you circle around the northern side of Ben A’an.
        On a sunny day like we had it this means finally some shade!

        There is a lay-by about 100 yards north of the Glengoyne distillery by
        the side of the A81 where you can park. Cross the road, taking extra
        care as the traffic can travel fast, and follow a track going up past
        some white cottages. When the track forks turn right and follow it up
        past a large metal gate and up through trees.After crossing a small burn
        go through a gate on the right and into a field. Bear left to pass in
        front of two large arrays of solar panels and walk diagonally across the
        field, straight towards Dumgoyne hill.
      </p>
      At the far side of the field cross two stiles and then begin the extremely
      steep walk up the obvious path ahead – take your time. As you get further
      up the hill you can look back for views opening up over Loch Lomond – to
      the right of the loch is Conic Hill with Ben Lomond behind it.
      <p>
        Head straight up the steep slope and after ascending over a false
        summit, you reach an upright stone on the top and even more extensive
        views which are simply breathtaking.Descending from the hill is best
        done by retracing your steps back to the start. Make sure to bring
        plenty of water and wear appropriate footwear (walking boots or
        similar).

        Loudoun Hill sticks out prominently on Ordnance Survey maps as a
        concentrated blotch of red contour lines amongst flattish Ayrshire
        farmland close to Darvel. Robert the Bruce led the Scots to victory over
        the English here in 1307, with an additional battle a decade earlier
        featuring Sir William Wallace, documented in poetry and in the striking
        Spirit of Scotland monument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays this craggy volcanic plug features several rock climbing routes
        - a rarity for this part of Scotland - and paths accessing these also
        help walkers heading for the summit by a less vertiginous route. The
        southeastern slopes facing the car park are impregnable without
        scrambling, but informal paths head steeply up the flanks on each side
        to form a circular walk. The hill looks best during the morning, but the
        best summit views are at sunset.

          <h2>Conic Hill</h2>

          />

        <p>
            Conic Hill is one of the great wee hills that surrounds Glasgow and makes for an ideal trip that can be fitted in to a few hours, or whole day, depending on the season and time at your disposal. It’s particularly good for a walk in the winter when the short days make longer trips to the hills more difficult, or as an introduction to the hills for children and those training to bag Munros and higher mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considering Conic is only around 400 metres high, it definitely punches above its height with a superb panorama that is the equal of many higher mountains. Although less than half the height of a Munro, its location at the south east end of Loch Lomond delivers breathtaking views, not only over the loch, but also as far south as  Arran.
