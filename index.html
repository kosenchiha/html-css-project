          <h3>Benefit of hiking</h3>
          <p>
            Like brisk walking, hiking is a good way to improve your
            cardiovascular fitness, particularly if your route includes some
            hills, which will force your heart to work harder. Taking a hike on
            the slightly uneven surface of a trail also provides a natural way
            to engage the core muscles in your torso and to hone your balance
            skills.

          <p>
            Ben Lomond is one of the most popular Munros, rewarding the 30,000
            people who make it to the top with fantastic views of the length of
            Loch Lomond and far into the hills to the north and the Trossachs to
            the east. The route has been well made, however the optional return
            down the Ptarmigan ridge can be muddy and is rocky in places making
            the going more difficult in poor visibility.

            One of my favorite things about Glasgow is that it is so close to
            the southern Highlands, that I can see the hills north of the city
            from my living room window. On a sunny day that is… Last weekend was
            yet another glorious sunshine-filled one, so we decided it was time
            to leave Glasgow behind. A rental car was quickly booked for the day
            and I already knew where I wanted to go for this perfect day hike:
            Ben A’an.

            There is a lay-by about 100 yards north of the Glengoyne distillery
            by the side of the A81 where you can park. Cross the road, taking
            extra care as the traffic can travel fast, and follow a track going
            up past some white cottages. When the track forks turn right and
            follow it up past a large metal gate and up through trees.After
            crossing a small burn go through a gate on the right and into a
            field. Bear left to pass in front of two large arrays of solar
            panels and walk diagonally across the field, straight towards
            Dumgoyne hill.

            Loudoun Hill sticks out prominently on Ordnance Survey maps as a
            concentrated blotch of red contour lines amongst flattish Ayrshire
            farmland close to Darvel. Robert the Bruce led the Scots to victory
            over the English here in 1307, with an additional battle a decade
            earlier featuring Sir William Wallace, documented in poetry and in
            the striking Spirit of Scotland monument.

          <p>
            Conic Hill is one of the great wee hills that surrounds Glasgow and
            makes for an ideal trip that can be fitted in to a few hours, or
            whole day, depending on the season and time at your disposal. It’s
            particularly good for a walk in the winter when the short days make
            longer trips to the hills more difficult, or as an introduction to
            the hills for children and those training to bag Munros and higher
            mountains.
